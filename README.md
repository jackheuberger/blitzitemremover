# blitzitemremover
Removes the League of Legends itemsets left over by blitz.gg on uninstall

# How to use:
Change the `champdirs` directory to your 'Champions' directory in your LoL install location.
- The default LoL install is under C:\Riot Games\League of Legends
- I would then write as the path: `C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\\Champions`
